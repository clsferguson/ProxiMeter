# Specification Quality Checklist: YOLO Object Detection with Bounding Boxes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written from a user perspective, focusing on "what" users need (object detection with configurable models, label filtering, confidence thresholds, and visual bounding boxes) rather than "how" to implement it. No specific implementation details like Python libraries, React components, or database schemas are included.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific and actionable
   - All 20 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by setting env vars and verifying model loads)
   - Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "within 30 seconds", SC-002: "under 200ms")
   - Success criteria avoid implementation details and focus on outcomes (e.g., "users can select from all 80 COCO class labels" rather than "multi-select dropdown component")
   - Edge cases are comprehensive and cover error scenarios, boundary conditions, and runtime issues

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Four prioritized user stories (P1, P2) provide independent, testable value
   - Each story includes Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios
   - Success criteria align with user stories and provide measurable outcomes
   - Assumptions section clearly documents constraints and defaults
   - Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature

## Notes

The specification is ready to proceed to planning (`/speckit.plan`). No issues or concerns identified.
