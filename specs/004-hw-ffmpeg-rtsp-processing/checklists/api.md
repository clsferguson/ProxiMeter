# API Requirements Quality Checklist

**Feature**: 004-hw-ffmpeg-rtsp-processing  
**Created**: October 23, 2025  
**Focus**: API endpoints for stream and zone management, including MJPEG streaming and health/metrics  
**Purpose**: Unit tests for API requirements to ensure completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage in the specification and OpenAPI contract. This validates that API requirements are well-written and ready for implementation, not the implementation itself.  
**Audience**: PR Reviewers and API Designers  
**Depth**: Standard (focus on core endpoints, schemas, and error handling)  

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 - Are all necessary CRUD endpoints for streams (create, read, update, delete) explicitly documented in the requirements? [Completeness, Spec FR-001, OpenAPI /streams]
- [x] CHK002 - Are endpoints for starting and stopping stream processing defined with clear request/response expectations? [Completeness, Spec FR-002, OpenAPI /streams/{stream_id}/start]
- [x] CHK003 - Is the MJPEG streaming endpoint specified for delivering processed frames to the frontend? [Completeness, Spec FR-002, OpenAPI /streams/{stream_id}/mjpeg]
- [x] CHK004 - Are zone management endpoints (CRUD for zones per stream) included in the API requirements? [Completeness, Spec FR-005, OpenAPI /streams/{stream_id}/zones]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are health and metrics endpoints required for monitoring stream processing? [Completeness, Spec FR-005, OpenAPI /health and /metrics]
- [ ] CHK006 - Are requirements for SSE endpoints for real-time scoring updates documented, even if optional? [Gap, Completeness, Spec Assumptions]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK007 - Is the request body schema for creating a stream clearly defined, including fields like url, hw_accel_enabled, and ffmpeg_params? [Clarity, OpenAPI StreamCreate]
- [ ] CHK008 - Are response formats for successful operations (e.g., 201 Created for stream creation) specified with exact JSON structures? [Clarity, OpenAPI /streams POST]
- [ ] CHK009 - Is the multipart/x-mixed-replace boundary and content type for MJPEG clearly quantified in the requirements? [Clarity, Spec FR-002, OpenAPI /streams/{stream_id}/mjpeg]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are custom FFmpeg parameters described as an array of strings with validation rules? [Clarity, Spec FR-006, OpenAPI StreamCreate ffmpeg_params]
- [ ] CHK011 - Is the target FPS parameter defined with a default value and constraints (e.g., minimum 1, maximum 30)? [Clarity, Spec FR-002, OpenAPI StreamCreate target_fps]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK012 - Do stream and zone schemas align consistently across create, update, and response objects? [Consistency, OpenAPI Stream vs StreamCreate vs StreamUpdate]
- [ ] CHK013 - Are status enums (e.g., stopped, running, error) consistent across stream responses and health checks? [Consistency, OpenAPI Stream status, Spec FR-005]
- [x] CHK014 - Is hardware acceleration handling consistent between stream configuration and processing endpoints? [Consistency, Spec FR-003 and FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 - Can API success criteria (e.g., 95% frame delivery without errors) be objectively measured via response times or metrics? [Measurability, Spec Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK016 - Are error response requirements testable, such as specific HTTP status codes for invalid FFmpeg params? [Measurability, Spec Edge Cases, OpenAPI responses]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK017 - Are primary scenarios (e.g., successful stream creation and MJPEG retrieval) covered in API requirements? [Coverage, Spec User Story 1]
- [x] CHK018 - Are alternate scenarios (e.g., updating stream with new FFmpeg params) addressed? [Coverage, Spec FR-004]
- [ ] CHK019 - Are exception scenarios (e.g., invalid RTSP URL) specified with error responses? [Coverage, Spec Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 - Are requirements defined for API behavior when hardware acceleration is unavailable (e.g., fallback indication in responses)? [Edge Case, Spec Edge Cases, Gap]
- [ ] CHK021 - Is disconnection handling specified for MJPEG endpoints (e.g., stream status updates)? [Edge Case, Spec Edge Cases, OpenAPI /streams/{stream_id}/mjpeg]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are concurrent stream operations (e.g., starting multiple streams) covered in requirements? [Edge Case, Spec Success Criteria]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK023 - Are rate-limiting requirements for API endpoints documented to prevent abuse? [Non-Functional, Spec Assumptions, Gap]
- [x] CHK024 - Is authentication or authorization specified for API endpoints, or explicitly excluded for LAN-only? [Non-Functional, Spec Assumptions, Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 - Are performance requirements for API responses (e.g., <200ms for health checks) quantified? [Non-Functional, Spec Success Criteria]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK026 - Are dependencies on FFmpeg availability and GPU detection documented in API requirements? [Dependencies, Spec FR-003, Plan Technical Context]
- [x] CHK027 - Is the assumption of no video storage reflected in the absence of storage-related API endpoints? [Assumptions, Spec Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK028 - Is 'processed frames' clearly defined in terms of format and metadata included in API responses? [Ambiguity, Spec FR-002]
- [ ] CHK029 - Do zone point coordinates conflict with stream resolution assumptions in requirements? [Conflict, Spec Key Entities, Gap]
