# Specification Quality Checklist: FastAPI RTSP Streams and Landing UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

Validation Results (updated after clarifications):

- Content Quality:
  - No implementation details: FAIL (FastAPI is specified per requirement, and a file path is referenced for config persistence). Note: This is an intentional product constraint per user direction.
  - Focused on user value: PASS.
  - Written for non-technical stakeholders: PASS.
  - All mandatory sections completed: PASS.

- Requirement Completeness:
  - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: PASS (resolved: plaintext credentials in config with warning; validate on save but allow inactive; migrate to FastAPI).
  - Requirements testable and unambiguous: PASS.
  - Success criteria measurable: PASS.
  - Success criteria technology-agnostic: PASS.
  - Acceptance scenarios defined: PASS.
  - Edge cases identified: PASS.
  - Scope clearly bounded: PASS.
  - Dependencies and assumptions identified: PASS (storage format and framework decisions recorded).

- Feature Readiness:
  - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria: PASS.
  - User scenarios cover primary flows: PASS.
  - Meets measurable outcomes: PASS.
  - No implementation details leak: FAIL (FastAPI constraint accepted as product decision).

Action Items:

1) Proceed to planning with FastAPI migration, RTSP handling, config persistence, and UI flows per spec.
