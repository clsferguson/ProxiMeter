- [ ] CHK002 Are increment interaction requirements captured for single click semantics and immediate value update? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK003 Are persistence lifecycle requirements documented for first run, reloads, app restarts, and container restarts with a bound host volume? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK004 Are health endpoint requirements complete (route, readiness condition, status code, body)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 Are container build/run/documentation requirements complete, including volume mapping instructions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006, §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK006 Are licensing requirements complete and precise (MIT text, holder, year)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK007 Are CI workflow requirements fully captured across triggers, platform, smoke test, failure criteria, and logs? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011–§FR-014]

## Requirement Clarity
- [ ] CHK008 Is “dark theme with purple highlights” defined with specific color tokens/hex values and contrast expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001, Gap]
- [ ] CHK009 Is “immediately” quantified for UI update (e.g., ≤ 200 ms on local) and aligned with success criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002; Success §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK010 Is the configuration path and format explicitly specified (file name, directory, schema for key `counter`)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003; Data §Configuration]
- [ ] CHK011 Is persistence behavior across container restarts clarified for both with and without a mounted host volume? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004; Quickstart]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the `/health` response shape specified (plain text vs JSON) and what “ready” means operationally? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005, Gap]
- [ ] CHK013 Is the CI “reasonable startup window” defined with a numeric timeout that matches SC-007? [Clarity, Spec §FR-013; Success §SC-007]

## Requirement Consistency
- [ ] CHK014 Do User Story 1 narratives align with FR-002–FR-004 on immediacy and persistence semantics? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1; §FR-002–§FR-004]
- [ ] CHK015 Do success criteria thresholds (e.g., ≤ 2 s page readiness) match the narrative term “immediately”? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001; §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK016 Do Quickstart volume instructions match the specified config path and file name in spec/plan? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003; Plan §Project Structure; Quickstart]
- [ ] CHK017 Do CI platform and constraints (linux/amd64, hosted runners) remain consistent between spec and plan? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011–§FR-012; Plan §Technical Context]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality
- [ ] CHK018 Are acceptance scenarios mapped to measurable pass/fail thresholds and linked to their corresponding FR IDs? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Story 1; §SC-001–§SC-004]
- [ ] CHK019 Is the health readiness condition measurable in CI (exact status code, body check, and startup timeout)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-007; §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK020 Is the contributor experience target (≤ 10 minutes) backed by explicit steps in documentation to make it testable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-005; §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK021 Are CI duration targets (≤ 5 minutes) attributable to defined workflow steps and artifacts? [Measurability, Spec §SC-006; §FR-011]

## Scenario Coverage
- [ ] CHK022 Are primary flows for initial load, viewing, and incrementing defined for first run and subsequent visits? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1; §FR-001–§FR-004]
- [ ] CHK023 Are alternate/malformed configuration scenarios covered with defined behavior and user-visible messaging? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases; §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK024 Are write-failure scenarios (permissions/read-only filesystem) covered with specified behavior and messaging? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases; §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK025 Are concurrency scenarios (rapid clicks/multiple sessions) addressed with ordering and persistence semantics? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage
- [ ] CHK026 Are zero-state and recovery behaviors explicitly specified for UI copy and logging when `config.yml` is missing or malformed? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases; Gap]
- [ ] CHK027 Is behavior defined when the config directory is missing or mounted read-only in the container? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases; §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK028 Are port conflicts or container startup failures acknowledged with guidance in docs or requirements? [Edge Case, Quickstart, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] CHK029 Are performance targets consolidated and specific (UI latency, health response, startup/readiness)? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-001–§SC-004]
- [ ] CHK030 Is the security posture documented (non-root, no-auth, LAN-only) and reflected in user-facing docs? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-009–§FR-010; Plan §Security]
- [ ] CHK031 Is observability/logging explicitly excluded for this MVP and is that exclusion documented to prevent scope creep? [Non-Functional, Plan §Observability; Research §Decisions, Exclusion]
- [ ] CHK032 Are accessibility requirements specified for keyboard navigation and focus states for all interactive UI? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-010, Gap]
- [ ] CHK033 Are color contrast and focus visibility requirements measurable (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA thresholds)? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-010, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [ ] CHK034 Are external dependency assumptions (none required) documented along with implications and boundaries? [Assumption, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK035 Are platform/build assumptions documented (linux/amd64, hosted runners) with rationales and alternatives out of scope? [Dependency, Spec §FR-011–§FR-012; Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK036 Is the persistence assumption explicit that a host volume is required for cross-container persistence? [Assumption, Spec §FR-004; Quickstart]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts
- [ ] CHK037 Is the user-facing copy (“Hello”) and any i18n/accessibility guidance finalized to avoid ambiguity? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001, Gap]
- [ ] CHK038 Are the terms “reasonable startup window” and the 30 s CI timeout harmonized to avoid conflicting interpretations? [Conflict Risk, Spec §FR-013; Success §SC-007]
