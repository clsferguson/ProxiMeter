# Feature Specification: Minimum Working App – Hello Counter MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-flask-hello-counter`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to start with the creation of a minimum working application. I want to have the project working. Lets get the flask webserver up and running in the docker image. create a placeholder readme. MIT licence. The web UI can just be a hello world landing page, (dark theme, purple highlights) with a button and counter. store the counter value in the config.yml as a placeholder. so when the page is closed and opened the number persists."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - See and increment counter (Priority: P1)

A user opens the landing page, sees a "Hello" message styled with a dark theme and purple highlights, sees the current counter value, and clicks a button to increment the counter. The value updates immediately and remains the same after reloading or revisiting the page.

Why this priority: Delivers the core MVP value: a working UI and persistent state demonstrating end‑to‑end app readiness.

Independent Test: Load the page, click the increment button, refresh the page; the counter value remains incremented.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given no existing configuration file, When the user first loads the page, Then the counter is shown as 0 and a configuration file is created with that value.
2. Given a visible counter value X, When the user clicks the increment button once, Then the counter displays X+1 and the stored value is updated immediately.
3. Given the counter value was updated, When the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens the browser, Then the counter still shows the updated value.

### User Story 2 - Run the app in a container (Priority: P2)

An operator builds and runs the application in a container and can access the landing page in a browser. A health endpoint confirms the service is running.

Why this priority: Ensures the application is operational in its intended packaging and easily verifiable.

Independent Test: Build the container image, run it locally, visit the landing page and the health endpoint.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given the repository, When following the README steps, Then an image builds successfully and a container runs serving the landing page.
2. Given a running container, When requesting GET /health, Then the response is HTTP 200 with a simple body (e.g., "ok").

### User Story 3 - Repository housekeeping (Priority: P3)

A contributor finds a placeholder README with usage instructions and a permissive license in the repository root.

Why this priority: Improves contributor experience and clarifies legal use from day one.

Independent Test: Verify the presence and contents of the README and license file.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given the repository, When opening the README, Then it explains what the project is and how to build/run the container locally.
2. Given the repository, When opening the license file, Then it contains the full MIT License text with the correct copyright line.

### Edge Cases

- Config file missing: created on first read with default counter 0.
- Config file unreadable or malformed: reset only the counter key to a safe default (0) and continue; log a user‑visible note on the page.
- Write failure (filesystem permissions or read‑only): page shows current in‑memory value and a visible error message; no crash.
- Concurrent increments (multiple rapid clicks or multiple sessions): increments are applied sequentially and persisted; the displayed value reflects the latest successful write.
- Very large counter values: application prevents overflow by capping at a reasonable maximum (e.g., 2,147,483,647); shows a message if max reached.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: Provide a simple landing page with a dark theme and purple highlights that greets the user (e.g., "Hello") and displays the current counter value.
- FR-002: Provide a single button that increments the counter and updates the displayed value immediately.
- FR-003: Persist the counter value in a human‑readable configuration file named `config.yml` under an application configuration directory in the project/release artifact. If the file does not exist, create it with `counter: 0` on first run.
- FR-004: The stored counter value must persist across page reloads and application restarts. When the application runs in a container, persistence must be retained across container restarts when the configuration path is bound to a host volume.
- FR-005: Expose a simple health endpoint at `/health` that returns HTTP 200 and a short body when the service is ready to serve requests.
- FR-006: Package the application to run inside a container image and document build/run steps in the README, including how to map a host volume for `config.yml` persistence.
- FR-007: Include a top‑level `README.md` describing the project purpose, how to build/run locally (including container usage), and the persistence behavior.
- FR-008: Include a top‑level `LICENSE` file with the MIT License text and correct copyright holder and year.
- FR-009: Do not require authentication or external services for this MVP.
- FR-010: Keep all specification and UI language neutral and accessible; avoid implementation‑specific details in user‑facing documentation.

### Key Entities (data)

- Configuration: YAML file with a single key `counter` (integer ≥ 0). Additional keys may be added in future versions.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: From first page load, a user can read and increment the counter and see the new value persist after a reload within 2 seconds.
- SC-002: On a clean start with no existing config file, the application creates `config.yml` containing `counter: 0` within 1 second of first request.
- SC-003: After incrementing the counter and restarting the application (or container), the first page load shows the last stored value 100% of the time under normal local conditions.
- SC-004: Health endpoint responds with HTTP 200 in under 200 ms on a local machine when the service is ready.
- SC-005: A new contributor can follow the README to build and run the container locally in under 10 minutes without prior project knowledge.
