- [x] CHK023 Can video playback timing requirements be measured? [Measurability, Spec SC-006]
- [x] CHK024 Are responsive design requirements defined with testable viewport sizes? [Measurability, Spec SC-007]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK025 Are UX requirements defined for zero-stream scenarios? [Coverage, Spec User Story 1 scenario 3]
- [x] CHK026 Are requirements specified for concurrent user access scenarios? [Coverage, Spec Assumptions]
- [x] CHK027 Are UX requirements defined for network failure scenarios? [Coverage, Spec Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK028 Are requirements specified for very long stream names or URLs? [Coverage, Spec Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK029 Are UX requirements defined for multiple simultaneous streams? [Coverage, Spec Edge Cases: concurrent users]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK030 Is fallback behavior specified when video codec is unsupported? [Edge Case, Spec User Story 4 Video Player Specifications]
- [x] CHK031 Are requirements defined for RTSP stream unavailability during playback? [Edge Case, Spec User Story 4 Video Player Specifications]
- [x] CHK032 Is behavior specified for very long stream names in UI lists? [Edge Case, Spec Edge Cases: 40 chars with ellipsis]
- [x] CHK033 Are requirements defined for touch interactions on mobile devices? [Edge Case, Spec FR-008: 44x44px touch targets]
- [x] CHK034 Is behavior specified when backend is unreachable during initial load? [Edge Case, Spec Edge Cases: error message + Retry button]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK035 Are touch target size requirements defined for mobile interactions? [Non-Functional, FR-008]
- [ ] CHK036 Are animation performance requirements specified for smooth interactions? [Non-Functional, Optional]

**Note**: Accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation, screen readers, color contrast) are deferred to future enhancements and not in scope for this migration.

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK037 Is the assumption of "existing backend API unchanged" validated? [Assumption, Spec Assumptions]
- [x] CHK038 Are browser compatibility requirements explicitly documented? [Dependency, Spec Assumptions]
- [x] CHK039 Is the assumption of "trusted LAN environment" reflected in UX requirements? [Assumption, Spec Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK040 Is "preserve existing UI/UX design" defined with specific visual references? [Ambiguity, Spec FR-002, Assumptions]
- [x] CHK041 Are there conflicts between "preserve design" and "modern React patterns"? [Conflict, Resolved]

**Resolution for CHK041**: Preserve the existing visual design and layout from src/templates/*.html while using modern React component architecture, TypeScript patterns, and optional animation libraries for enhanced interactions. The design stays, the implementation modernizes.
