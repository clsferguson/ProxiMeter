**Purpose**: Validate the quality and completeness of API integration requirements for the React SPA, ensuring REST API contracts, error handling, and real-time communication are properly specified.
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: specs/003-frontend-react-migration/spec.md

- [x] CHK014 Is "real-time stream status" specified with update frequency? [Clarity, Spec FR-012: every 2 seconds]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK015 Are error response formats consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency, openapi.yaml: ErrorResponse with detail field]
- [x] CHK016 Are field naming conventions consistent in request/response schemas? [Consistency, openapi.yaml: snake_case throughout]
- [x] CHK017 Are HTTP status code usage consistent for similar operations? [Consistency, openapi.yaml: 400=validation, 404=not found, 500=server error]
- [x] CHK018 Are API integration patterns consistent across all pages? [Consistency, Spec API Integration Requirements]
- [x] CHK019 Are validation error handling requirements consistent for forms? [Consistency, Spec FR-017: parse detail field]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK020 Are API response time requirements measurable? [Measurability, Spec API Integration: 10s timeout]
- [x] CHK021 Can "form validation prevents invalid inputs" be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec SC-005]
- [x] CHK022 Are "no JavaScript console errors" requirements measurable? [Measurability, Spec SC-008]
- [x] CHK023 Can "starts playing within 3 seconds" be measured? [Measurability, Spec SC-006]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK024 Are API requirements defined for network failure scenarios? [Coverage, Spec API Integration Error Handling]
- [x] CHK025 Are requirements specified for concurrent API calls? [Coverage, Spec Assumptions: stateless frontend]
- [x] CHK026 Are API requirements defined for backend unavailability? [Coverage, Spec Edge Cases: backend unreachable]
- [x] CHK027 Are requirements specified for partial API response failures? [Coverage, Spec API Integration: HTTP status codes]
- [ ] CHK028 Are API requirements defined for large data sets? [Coverage, Not applicable - small stream lists]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK029 Is behavior specified for invalid RTSP URLs in API requests? [Edge Case, Spec User Story 2: validation error]
- [x] CHK030 Are requirements defined for API timeouts during form submission? [Edge Case, Spec API Integration: 10s timeout]
- [x] CHK031 Is behavior specified when API returns unexpected data formats? [Edge Case, Spec API Integration: HTTP 500 handling]
- [ ] CHK032 Are requirements defined for API rate limiting scenarios? [Edge Case, Not in scope - LAN environment]
- [ ] CHK033 Is behavior specified for SSE connection failures? [Edge Case, Future enhancement - not in this migration]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK034 Are API security requirements specified (CORS, input validation)? [Non-Functional, Backend responsibility]
- [x] CHK035 Are API performance requirements quantified? [Non-Functional, Spec SC-001: <2s dashboard load]
- [ ] CHK036 Are API reliability requirements defined (uptime, failover)? [Non-Functional, Out of scope - LAN environment]
- [ ] CHK037 Are API monitoring/logging requirements specified? [Non-Functional, Backend responsibility]

**Note**: Security, monitoring, and logging are backend responsibilities documented in specs/002-fastapi-rtsp-streams/.

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK038 Is the assumption of "existing backend API endpoints unchanged" validated? [Assumption, Spec Assumptions: validated against openapi.yaml]
- [x] CHK039 Are external API dependencies documented? [Dependency, None - only internal backend API]
- [x] CHK040 Is the assumption of "trusted LAN environment" reflected in API requirements? [Assumption, Spec Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK041 Is "fetch or axios" choice specified with rationale? [Ambiguity, Spec FR-004: axios preferred for interceptors]
- [x] CHK042 Are there conflicts between API requirements and no-auth policy? [Conflict, Resolved - LAN environment, no auth needed]
- [x] CHK043 Is "proper error handling" defined with specific error types? [Ambiguity, Spec API Integration Error Handling]
